Mean

mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
Following is the description of the parameters used −

x is the input vector.

trim is used to drop some observations from both end of the sorted vector.

na.rm is used to remove the missing values from the input vector.

Example

# Create a vector. 
x <- c(12,7,3,4.2,18,2,54,-21,8,-5)

# Find Mean.
result.mean <- mean(x)
print(result.mean)\

When trim = 0.3, 3 values from each end will be dropped from the calculations to find mean.

x <- c(12,7,3,4.2,18,2,54,-21,8,-5)

# Find Mean.
result.mean <-  mean(x,trim = 0.3)
print(result.mean)

x <- c(12,7,3,4.2,18,2,54,-21,8,-5,NA)

# Find mean.
result.mean <-  mean(x)
print(result.mean)

# Find mean dropping NA values.
result.mean <-  mean(x,na.rm = TRUE)
print(result.mean)

Median


The middle most value in a data series is called the median. The median() function is used in R to calculate this value.

median(x, na.rm = FALSE)
Following is the description of the parameters used −

x is the input vector.

na.rm is used to remove the missing values from the input vector.

Example

# Create the vector.
x <- c(12,7,3,4.2,18,2,54,-21,8,-5)

# Find the median.
median.result <- median(x)
print(median.result)


Mode

getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}


v <- c(2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,5,5,3,2,3)

# Calculate the mode using the user function.
result <- getmode(v)
print(result)


Linear Regressions

y = ax + b
Following is the description of the parameters used −

y is the response variable.

x is the predictor variable.

a and b are constants which are called the coefficients.

lm() Function
This function creates the relationship model between the predictor and the response variable.

lm(formula,data)
Following is the description of the parameters used −

formula is a symbol presenting the relation between x and y.

data is the vector on which the formula will be applied.


x <- c(151, 174, 138, 186, 128, 136, 179, 163, 152, 131)
y <- c(63, 81, 56, 91, 47, 57, 76, 72, 62, 48)

# Apply the lm() function.
relation <- lm(y~x)

predict() Function
Syntax
The basic syntax for predict() in linear regression is −

predict(object, newdata)
Following is the description of the parameters used −

object is the formula which is already created using the lm() function.

newdata is the vector containing the new value for predictor variable


Visualize the Regression Graphically

# Create the predictor and response variable.
x <- c(151, 174, 138, 186, 128, 136, 179, 163, 152, 131)
y <- c(63, 81, 56, 91, 47, 57, 76, 72, 62, 48)
relation <- lm(y~x)

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "linearregression.png")

# Plot the chart.
plot(y,x,col = "blue",main = "Height & Weight Regression",
abline(lm(x~y)),cex = 1.3,pch = 16,xlab = "Weight in Kg",ylab = "Height in cm")

# Save the file.
